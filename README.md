# Process Quality Monitoring Dashboard (Manufacturing / Pharma)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Statistical Process Control (SPC) based dashboard to monitor batch quality and detect abnormal process behavior in manufacturing environments.

The system analyzes batch-level process data and identifies:
- Out-of-control conditions
- High variability
- Potential quality risks

The focus is on **decision support**, not automation.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To convert historical batch data into actionable insights that help:
- QA teams monitor stability
- Process engineers detect abnormal trends
- Management assess process consistency

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit
- Statistical Process Control (SPC)

---

## 📊 Key Features
- ±3σ Control Limit Calculation
- Automatic Out-of-Control Detection
- Batch-Level Risk Identification
- Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
- Data-driven stability assessment

---

## 🧠 Industry Relevance
Manufacturing plants often run reactively.  
This system enables proactive monitoring by identifying unstable batches before they escalate into major deviations.

Even minor quality improvements can significantly reduce:
- Batch rejections
- Reprocessing
- Investigation time
